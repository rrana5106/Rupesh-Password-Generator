# Rupesh-Password-Generator
This my application to generate random password on criteria that user have selected.


## Description

This project was created to create an application that user can use to generate a random password based on the following criteria:

Length of password

-	At least 8 characters but no more than 128.

Character types

-	Lowercase
-	Uppercase
-	Numeric
-	Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
These helps user to create a password according to their length and the character types they have selected.
The main things I have learned from this project are how to use function, scope, loops, condition, object and array in JavaScript.
